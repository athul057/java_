###  public static void main(String[] args)

`public static void main(String[] args)` though this we can pass argument through command line .



for execcuting java program first `javac Main.java`
when we executing this we will get Main.class file will create.
once this file has created we can execute this java program by `java Main` command

we can pass arguments like this `java Main 1 athul 5 1_00_0` so every thing after Main will become arguments


we pass argument also this argument can obtain through `Arrays.toString(args)`
