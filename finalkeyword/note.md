`final` keyword is mainly using to make a constant value to our program .
Once we create a variable with `final` keyword we can't change the value of that variable.



we can also use `enum` to define constants .
Through enum we can create new data types.

```java
enum Gender{
MALE,
FEMALE
}
enum TShirtSize{
S,M,L,XL
}
```

This will create  a new constant data type Gender and TShirtSize;
enum is more preferred way to declare constants.


we can also define enum with 

````java
public enum TShirtSize{
S,M,L,XL
}
````

instead of class we can define the TShirtSize data type ..
